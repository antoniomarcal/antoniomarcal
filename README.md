## Adding posts

This theme utilises [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to organise Markdown and/or MDX files, as well as type-checking frontmatter with a schema -> `src/content/config.ts`.

Adding a post is as simple as adding your .md(x) files to the `src/content/post` folder, the filename of which will be used as the slug/url. The posts included with this template are there as an example of how to structure your frontmatter. Additionally, the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) has a detailed section on markdown pages.
